Introduction
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. We will use the raw data collected for both old and new versions of our webpage, set up our hypothesis and use statistics to either reject or accept the null hypothesis. Our goal is to use the ab_data and through A/B testing analysis help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
